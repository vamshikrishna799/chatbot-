Develop a java chatbot capable of engaging in conversation with users. The chatbot should understand natural language input and respond appropriately, providing relevant information or assistance. Utilize natural language processing techniques to enhance the 
ability to interpret user queries accurately. Ensure the chatbot's responses are contextually relevant and contribute to a seamless user experience.Additionally, Imagine you've been tasked withcreating comprehensive documentation for a java Chatbot project.Your
documentation should include detailed explanations of the code along with images illustrating the program's execution and user
interactions.
