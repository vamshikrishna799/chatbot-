**Task Description :**
the task assigned to G.vamshi krishna during the codtech IT solutions Internship program is to write a java program the create a SampleChatbot.

**Implementation**
the implementation of the task involves utilizing java programming language to create a simple program that iterates from samplechatbot . the program "do" loop to achiew this functionaaly efficiently. belowis the code implementation:

**java**
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.io.*;

public class SampleChatbot {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Chatbot: Hi! How can I assist you today?");
        String userInput;

        do {
            System.out.print("User: ");
            userInput = scanner.nextLine();

            String botResponse = generateResponse(userInput);

            System.out.println("Chatbot: " + botResponse);
        } while (!userInput.equalsIgnoreCase("exit"));

        System.out.println("Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day!");
        scanner.close();
    }

    public static String generateResponse(String userInput) {
        String response;

        switch (userInput.toLowerCase()) {
            case "hi":
            case "hello":
                response = "Hello there!";
                break;
            case "how are you":
                response = "I'm just a chatbot, but thanks for asking!";
                break;
            case "what is your name":
                response = "I'm just a simple chatbot. You can call me Chatbot.";
                break;
            case "tell me a joke":
                response = "Why did the math book look sad? Because it had too many problems! ðŸ˜„";
                break;
            case "wanna be friends":
                response = "We are already friends.";
                break;
            case "open notepad":
                try {
                    Runtime rs = Runtime.getRuntime();
                    rs.exec("notepad");
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    response = "Error: " + e.getMessage();
                }
                response = "Notepad opened.";
                break;
            case "exit":
                response = "Sure, exiting now.";
                break;
            default:
                response = "I'm not sure how to respond to that.";
                break;
        }

        return response;
    }
}

**Introduction**
Welcome to the documentation for the Java Chatbot project. This document aims to provide comprehensive guidance on understanding, setting up, and utilizing the Java Chatbot application. The Chatbot is designed to engage in conversation with users, understand natural language input, and respond appropriately using predefined responses.

**System Architecture**
The Java Chatbot application consists of a single main class (SampleChatbot) that handles user input and response generation. The architecture is straightforward, with a loop continuously accepting user input until the user decides to exit the conversation.
Java Chatbot Implementation
Step 1: Setting Up User Interface
Create a Java Swing or JavaFX application for the user interface.
Design the UI to include a text input field for user queries and a text area to display bot responses.
Step 2: Natural Language Processing
Integrate a natural language processing library such as OpenNLP or Stanford NLP for understanding user queries.
Preprocess user queries to remove stopwords, punctuation, and perform stemming/lemmatization.
Implement techniques like tokenization and part-of-speech tagging to analyze the structure of user queries.
Step 3: Response Generation
Develop a set of predefined responses or integrate with APIs for retrieving dynamic information.
Use conditional logic or machine learning algorithms to select the most appropriate response based on the user query.
Ensure responses are contextually relevant and contribute to a seamless user experience.
Step 4: Error Handling
Implement error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected user inputs gracefully.
Provide informative error messages to guide users in case of incorrect or unrecognized queries.
Step 5: Integration and Testing
Test the chatbot thoroughly using various user inputs to ensure accurate understanding and response generation.
Integrate any additional features such as persistent storage, voice input/output, or multi-threading as required.
Conduct usability testing to evaluate the overall user experience.
